The study of dynamic systems focuses on the behavior of physical systems
as well as the physics of individual components and the interactions
between them.  Control systems are designed to enable dynamic systems to
respond in a specific manner.  In this course, we will learn about the
mathematical modeling, analysis, and control of physical systems that
are in rest, in motion, or acted upon by a force. Dynamic systems can be
mechanical, electrical, thermal, hydraulic, pneumatic, or any
combination thereof.  An electrical motor is a good example of a dynamic
system in which electricity is used to drive the motor’s mechanical
movement.  The operation of the motor is controlled by altering the
electric current or voltage.  Another good example is a car’s suspension
system, which is designed to curb abnormal vibrations while riding on a
bumpy road.  In order to design a suspension system, you must analyze
the mathematical equations of the physics of the suspension and its
response (i.e. how effectively the system absorbs the vibrations).  The
springs between the tires and the chassis balance the weight and
maintain the height of the car.  The suspension system is controlled by
actuators (serving as shock absorbers) that curb the vibrations and
therefore make for a more comfortable driving experience. This course
explores the dynamics of mechanical, thermal, fluid, electrical, and
hybrid systems and sub-systems.  We will learn the mathematical models
(i.e. differential equations) that govern these systems and work to
understand how these systems respond to various inputs both in
time-domain and frequency-domain.  The course will also focus on
stability analysis of these systems with regards to controller designs.
 (We will take a look at a range of designs, from simple feedback
controls to advanced lead-lag compensators).  Controller design involves
complex mathematical calculations which should be handled by
mathematical computation tools like SCILAB, MATLAB, MathCAD, Maple, and
so forth.  As SCILAB is a freely available tool used for designing,
analyzing, and optimizing systems and controls, we will use SCILAB,
which will save us time and provide us with more accurate results.  You
have already used SCILAB in
[ME101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me101/).  MATLAB users who are not
familiar with SCILAB can used a tool in SCILAB (please see UNIT 4) that
converts MATLAB codes to SCILAB codes. We will begin by learning about
the different types of dynamic systems through various examples and
reviewing relevant mathematical material (much of which you may already
know), which will enable you to better understand the material covered
in this course.  We will then learn how to represent these systems using
different mathematical forms before analyzing them in terms of
frequency, time domain, and stability with respect to controller
design.  You will also take a close look at various controller designs
and learn how to apply SCILAB.  Finally, we will conclude the course by
visiting advanced topics and case studies in the field.
