**Unit 5: Advanced Topics and Case Studies** <span id="5"></span> 
**Once we have an understanding of dynamic systems and controls, it is
good to explore other advanced topics such as the ones outlined below. 
We will also look at case studies pertaining to controller designs for
various dynamic systems.**
